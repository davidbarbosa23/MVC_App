MVC App
==========

This is a test code for MVC Application as Senior PHP Developer

## How works

Test running [here](http://52.36.70.7/)

### Database
`MCV_App.sql` needs be inserted into an `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` collation database, after insert you can edit `app/database.php` with your DB access.

### Install
You need run the below command before init the application:

```console
$ cd {DIRECTORY_PATH}
$ composer install
$ npm install
```

### App Changes
After add/delete/rename files into `app/core` or `app/models` you need execute:
```console
$ composer dump-autoload
```

### Assets Changes
To edit JS or CSS files, please edit the assets files into `{DIRECTORY_PATH}/assets` folder, then execute:
```console
$ npm run build
```

### References
This application use [twig/twig](https://packagist.org/packages/twig/twig), ([twig reference](https://github.com/vito/chyrp/wiki/Twig-Reference)) for this reason, some times we need clear cache after any update into layouts:
```console
$ npm run clear
```
